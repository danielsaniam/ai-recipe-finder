# ai-recipe-finder
AI-Powered Recipe Finder for the "I am Cooking" Project

This project is composed for 3 notebooks:


## 1) IamCooking_Pinecone_query.ipynb:

  This notebook demonstrates the process of querying the latest version of the 'recipes-embeddings' Vector database, which has been established in Pinecone.
   
## 2) IamCooking.ipynb:

  This notebook demonstrates the process used to generate embeddings and details the method of storing them in the 'recipes-embeddings' Vector database on Pinecone.
   
## 3) IamCooking_Open_AI.ipynb:

  Future work: This notebook illustrates a similar process to that in IamCooking.ipynb, but it employs the OpenAI API. The use of this API introduces additional dimensions that enrich the vector space with more semantic aspects.
